TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION - "HOLY HEARTH"

1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Holy Hearth is a 2D rogue‑lite platformer featuring procedurally generated ruins and a system of magical runes. The game loop is built around short runs (10–20 minutes), collecting relics/runes and gradually strengthening the player character.
Development goals: responsive platforming controls, high replayability, and seamless integration of procedural generation.

2. GAME MECHANICS
2.1 Controls and Physics
Actions: walking, double jump, wall slide, dash.
Supports coyote time and jump buffering.
Dash grants brief invulnerability.

2.2 Magic System
Elements: Fire, Wind, Earth, Shadow.
Runes are equipped in slots and provide active and passive effects.
Combinations of r﻿
unes generate hybrid abilities following predefined rules.
Meta‑progression: upgrading slots and unlocking new runes.

2.3 Enemies and Bosses
Enemy types: patrolling, chasing, ranged, and flying.
AI: simple finite state machines (Idle, Patrol, Alert, Chase, Attack).
Bosses have phases and change their behavior at HP thresholds.

3. PROCEDURAL GENERATION
3.1 Room Modules
Each room is described by a JSON file: entrances/exits, biome, length, complexity, spawn points, and micro‑mechanics.

3.2 Generation Algorithm
1. Obtain seed.
2. Select biome and difficulty profile.
3. Stitch compatible rooms together.
4. Validate the path.
5. Place enemies and objects according to distribution tables.

4. SYSTEMS AND ARCHITECTURE
4.1 Data Formats
rooms/*.json — level modules
runes/*.json — runes
enemies/*.json — enemies

4.2 Contracts Between Subsystems
Generator → Scene: list of rooms + spawn table.
Rune system → Player: active effects.
AI → Level: waypoints, aggro zones.

4.3 Saving
Meta‑progression is saved persistently.
In‑run progress is saved partially via checkpoints.

5. ART AND SOUND
Hand‑drawn 2D graphics, 2–4 parallax layers.
Particle effects for magic and destruction.
Dynamic music reflecting depth and danger.

6. PERFORMANCE AND PLATFORMS
Target: 60 FPS on mobile.
Optimizations: sprite batching, object pooling.
Platforms: iOS/Android, later PC and Switch.

7. MVP (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT)
6–8 room modules.
3 biomes.
6 enemy types + 1–2 bosses.
Basic rune system (3 slots).
Level generator + basic UI/HUD.
